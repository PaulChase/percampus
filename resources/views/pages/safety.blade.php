                 <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>Don't trust users who want you to provide any kind of payment services or ask for extra fees for an item or service.</li>
                 <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>You are supposed to reject any request to use money transfer services such as; MoneyGram, Western Union or any money transfer platforms.</li>
                 <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>To ensure a safe transaction, the most basic rule to follow is not to pay in advance and must have the item before paying in cash or transfer.</li>
                 <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>You should check the item properly and ensure every detail is as expected by yourself before you pay for it.</li>
                 <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>If you're buying or selling a small-sized item, there's no reason why you should have to meet at someone's lodge (the buyer or seller insists that you come over to their house, approach with caution). Instead, meet in a well-lit, public place. </li>
                 <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>If an item seems too good to be true or something about the sale feels off, it probably is. So please, beware of unrealistic offers. It’s normally a ploy to get you to make a hasty, and costly, mistake. Use your intuition as your guide and only do business with people that you feel comfortable with.</li>
                 <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>If you're going to someone's room, make sure you bring a friend(s) along. Conversely, if you're going to be letting a buyer into your room, make sure you're not home alone.</li>

                <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>If it appears too good to be true, it probably is. Especially if it’s advertised at a suspiciously low price.</li>
                <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>The seller wants advance payment or initial deposit before sending you the item. They’ll often insist that you can pay the balance when collecting the item, or refund your money should you be unhappy with the item.</li>
                <li><span class="fa fa-caret-right text-green-500 mr-2"></span>The seller can’t meet you in a public place but wants to deliver the item personally.</li>
